Week 1:

    Attended the lab, introduced myself to the class, and found a group. Talked with my group members about the task during the lab and we all agreed to each read the project list and select preferable projects. 
    We selected a meeting time for next week to be Tuesday 7pm and I spent the rest of the week reading the projects and choosing projects 1, 5, 8, 9. Joining the Jira, Confluence, and GitHub group.

Week 2:

    Attended a meeting on Tuesday to decide on a project, we ended up choosing project 1 as that was the most prefereable. As a group we read through the project specification and requirements and delegated / volunteered for work to do. 
    Clarified the project spec and forumlated questions for Wednesday's lab.

    Attended the lab on Wednesday. Asked the lab tutor some questions regarding the project specification. My group members and I each created a few user stories and from these stories we brainstormed and discussed the 8 functionalities 
    we are required to implement. During the lab we settled on 6 core functionalities with the novel functionalities left open for further research. A couple functionalities I came up with were QR codes and guest logins and loyalty program. 

    Missed Saturday meeting, read the meeting minutes and caught up. Message the scrum leader to delegate some work to me and recieved a task to detail the novelty functionalities which i completed.

Week 3:

    Attended Monday meeting, consulted with team on planning structure of our project, drafting entity-relationship diagram for our database, finalising novel functionalities, and delegating future works. I presented my work completed between the last meeting and now. 
    Brought up the topic of choosing a full stack for development, and we settled on React, Express, and MySQL. From this meeting I had the tasks to create the entity-relationship diagram from the draft, and work with Christopher on the System Architecture.
    I designed and created a few diagrams including the entity-relationship diagram, system architecture diagram, and user interface diagram. I also wrote a part of the system architecture section outlining the back-end tech stack and their descriptions.
