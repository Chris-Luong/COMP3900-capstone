Week 1:

    Attended the lab, introduced myself to the class, and found a group. Talked with my group members about the task during the lab and we all agreed to each read the project list and select preferable projects. 
    We selected a meeting time for next week to be Tuesday 7pm and I spent the rest of the week reading the projects and choosing projects 1, 5, 8, 9. Joining the Jira, Confluence, and GitHub group.

Week 2:

    Attended a meeting on Tuesday to decide on a project, we ended up choosing project 1 as that was the most prefereable. As a group we read through the project specification and requirements and delegated / volunteered for work to do. 
    Clarified the project spec and forumlated questions for Wednesday's lab.

    Attended the lab on Wednesday. Asked the lab tutor some questions regarding the project specification. My group members and I each created a few user stories and from these stories we brainstormed and discussed the 8 functionalities 
    we are required to implement. During the lab we settled on 6 core functionalities with the novel functionalities left open for further research. A couple functionalities I came up with were QR codes and guest logins and loyalty program.
