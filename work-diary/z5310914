Week 1

Formed group and chose a group name. Started discussing potential topics that the group was interested in using for the assignment. Registered for Jira as scrum master initially but then chose to change scrum masters (made Alan the scrum master). Also discussed which group members had more experience working with backend or frontend. Asked tutor some questions in relation to the general assignment spec.

Week 2

Agreed with team members to meet 3 times a week to work on the assignment and discuss how things are progressing (including the 2 hour tutorial we meet for on wednesdays). Our group decided to go forward with project 1 (wait management project). I started a google docs for a rough outline of what was required for this project and assigned each team member with a section of criteria to deal with. 

During meeting we came up with our core functionalities and novel functions that we were planning to include in our proposal. I personally dealt with the introduction of our project and was assigned to find out existing wait management systems and their drawbacks. I also proposed the way our main functionality for the wait management staff would function. As a team we came up with user stories for each component of the project separately and aimed to combine several user stories to build a certain functionality.
Week 3

Completed my research on existing wait management systems and decided to include NextMe, Yelp Waitlist and WaitlistMe as the three main systems I wanted to discuss in the proposal. Started articulating the starting sections of our proposal where I came up with an introduction of the issues we were targeting and the solution we were proposing.
