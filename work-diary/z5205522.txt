Week 1:

Group formed and named. Completed expected tasks as a group during Week 1 Lab, including: registering group on Moodle, adding members to the group, Jira registration and contact exchange.
As a group, we discussed prior backend and frontend experience. Outlined tasks to complete during the week and set up a new meeting time to discuss those tasks.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week 2:

On Tuesday, we decided on a project (wait management) and worked through the given project requirements together so that everyone was on the same page. 
We worked on compiling drawbacks and problems of existing wait management systems on a document Gungeet started. We also broke down requirements into smaller tasks to tackle over the next weeks.
Questions and uncertainties were compiled to ask during the lab. 

On Wednesday, we began writing user stories for potentially core features and discussed what 8 functionalities we should have. We had difficulties coming up with novel functions and left that to be 
an individual task, where each member would be given time to research their own ideas. We aim to discuss these ideas in our next meeting. We discussed how to structure our core features and assigned
each to a member. Each member should try to expand on these features.

On Saturday, we began our proposal draft (see meeting minutes). I was tasked with creating a simple storyboard that covered at least the first 2-3 sprints, which I completed for discussion during our 
Monday meetings.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week 3:

My first task was to flesh out our novelty features. I ended up moving our booking feature (originally part of core 6 features) into the novelty category and decided on a loyalty program as the last
novelty. To make up for a missing core feature, I thought it was best to split another core feature (menu ordering + management) into two. I notified the team and they agreed.
My second task was to update our proposal draft and Jira user stories / product backlog with the novelty features. I also created epics on Jira to better organise everything.
I edited our proposal draft to reflect changes made in my first task and updated the user story screenshots. 

My final task for the week was working further on our storyboard. I have completed a majority of the features. There is one final feature to add (waiter staff interactions and their notification centre).
I have left this to Christopher, as he seemed more familiar with how the notification system should work. As part of the frontend section, it also gives him the chance to make changes and edits to
what I have in the storyboard so far.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week4:

In order to get ready for the demo, I wrapped up my tasks for the Register page which included form validation and sending requests to the completed /register endpoint. I also created a restaurant entry
page stub to get started on the guest profile Jira ticket. I fixed an issue with cors and another to do with the sendRequest function not resolving or rejecting responses properly.

I completed the functionality for guest profile and merged the staff and customer login pages after discussing with the team. I added new insert statements to create default staff accounts during 
database initialisation. Minor tasks included changing register so it redirects to login and worked on routing to display the appropriate components based on the logged in account's role. 
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week5:

After the demo and retrospective, we planned out and started our second sprint. Rodney and I were tasked with the "Menu Search, Filter and Sort" and "Manager Interactions" epics, while Grace,
Gungeet and Christopher were tasked with the big "Menu Ordering" epic. However, as Christopher was having trouble with MySQL and hence couldn't begin the epic, I thought that it was best if
I got started on it. I worked on the Jira ticket MN3900-2. I defined and created new tables for menu items and categories, then made a new query and an API endpoint to retrieve all menu
items from the database into a JSON object. On the frontend side, I worked on Menu.jsx to display cards for each item that was fetched using this new endpoint. We can now see a basic menu.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week6:

Talked with Rodney about how to design the menu screen and how we could incorporate filters and the order screen.
Added a filter modal that pops up on a button click with the required functionality and marked the menu search filter and sort epic as completed.
I started on the Manager Interactions epic by working on the UI and completing adding and deleting items. I worked with Rodney to design how we should design editing functionality.
I created endpoints to retrieve categories to do with a menu item and completed the edit Jira ticket. I also fixed some issues to do with filtering. 
MN3900-12, MN3900-13, MN3900-51, MN3900-29, MN3900-33, MN3900-35, MN3900-40 completed
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week7:

I fixed issues to do with editing item categories with Rodney and added form validation. I worked on thumbnail support for menu items on both the frontend and backend from the menu ordering epic.
I reworked the order drawer UI to show order history and fixed some bugs.
For Sprint 3, I was tasked with the kitchen staff order fulfilment tickets and completing the rest of the manager interactions epic. 
While completing MN3900-14 and MN3900-97, I fixed a bug to do with thumbnails and editing menu items.
I also completed the UI for kitchen staff, and am waiting on a status endpoint
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week8:

I created an endpoint to update status and updated staff components to use this endpoint.
This means that MN3900-11, MN3900-6, MN3900-49, MN3900-7 and MN3900-50 are completed.

For Sprint 4, I worked on the Notifications epic and added notifications with WebSockets.
MN3900-8, MN3900-10 and MN3900-4 have finished.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week9:

Helping out with Booking epic. Found a few issues and am trying to resolve them.
Completed the backend and frontend for loyalty program. Chris and I have found a few issues with the way we have structured our frontend code. Will be working on fixing that.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================
Week10:

Fixing bug from last week and reviewing frontend code to ensure good software quality.
